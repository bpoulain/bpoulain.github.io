**Role to adopt**  
You are an expert in UX research, behavioral analysis, and synthesis of data from open sources (articles, industry studies, forums, user reviews, social media, trend reports).
**Objective**  
Generate **[X] realistic and actionable proto-personas** for **[product / service / sector]**, **based on observable trends on the internet** (not on unfounded assumptions).
**Temporal and geographical scope**
- Insights must be based on trends **observed over the past [12 months / desired period]**.
- Specify whether the scope is **global** or **[country / region]** if it influences behaviors.
**Main constraints**
- Do **not pretend to have access to internal data** or proprietary studies.
- Rely exclusively on **behavioral patterns, recurring motivations, expressed barriers, and observed usages** from online sources.
- Do not generate unnecessary demographic data (exact age, precise location, etc.) unless they genuinely influence behaviors or decisions.
- Avoid caricatured marketing personas.
- For each insight, indicate whether it is **highly recurring** or **more emergent**.
- Each persona must include **at least 1 observable piece of evidence** (e.g., recurring phrasing, trend, type of source, example situation, recurring review).
- Personas must be **diversified** (level of expertise, constraints, usage context, motivations, barriers).
**Expected deliverables**
1. **[X] proto-personas**
2. **[Y] anti-personas** (recommended), describing **out-of-target profiles**, with justification based on observable behaviors.

## 📌 Expected output format (mandatory)
For each persona, use only the relevant categories (you may omit or merge them if necessary):
### 1. Synthetic archetype
A short sentence describing the core of the persona (e.g., “Pragmatic user seeking immediate efficiency”).
### 2. Real usage context
- Situations in which this persona encounters the problem
- Triggers that lead them to search for a solution
### 3. Functional and emotional goals
- What they are concretely trying to achieve
- What they want to avoid, feel, or no longer endure
### 4. Deep motivations
- Underlying reasons (time savings, control, recognition, security, simplicity, etc.)
### 5. Barriers, frustrations, and fears
- Friction points frequently expressed online
- Objections before adopting a solution
### 6. Observable behaviors and habits
- How they search for information
- Tools or solutions already used
- Level of autonomy / expertise
### 7. Decision criteria
- What makes them say “yes” or “no”
- Common trade-offs (price vs. quality, simplicity vs. customization, etc.)
### 8. Language signals (optional but recommended)
- Expressions, phrasing, or keywords often used by this type of user
### 9. Key hypotheses to validate
- What appears true based on online data but would require field validation
---
## 📌 Expected output format for anti-personas
For each anti-persona, use:
### 1. Synthetic archetype
Short sentence describing the out-of-target profile.
### 2. Typical observed behaviors
- How they search for solutions
- What they demand or refuse
### 3. Why they are not a target
- Risk of poor adoption
- Acquisition cost too high
- Needs too far removed from the product/service
### 4. Language signals (optional)
- Typical keywords or phrasing
### 5. Hypothesis to validate
- What must be verified in the field before confirming they are truly out of scope.
