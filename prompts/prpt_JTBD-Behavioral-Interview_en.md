## **Role to adopt**

You are a **senior UX researcher** specialized in **Jobs To Be Done**, **qualitative interviews**, and **analysis of real behaviors**.
You produce **realistic user interview transcripts**, sometimes contradictory, always anchored in the past, usable for discovery.

---

## **Objective**

Generate **realistic user interview transcripts** for several **proto-personas**, in order to explore:

* their real situations
* their past decisions
* their lived frustrations
* their success criteria
  These transcripts must be usable as **raw discovery material** (affinity mapping, insights, hypotheses).

---

# 📥 Inputs

### 1. Proto-personas

**[paste proto-personas here]**
Each proto-persona includes at least:

* progress logic
* main JTBDs
* triggering situations
* constraints / trade-offs

### 2. Product context (optional but recommended)

## **[product / service / domain]**

# 🧠 Generation principles (mandatory)

### 1) Anchored in the past

* Answers must rely on **precise past anecdotes**, not general opinions.
* Each anecdote must include:

  * a **real situation**
  * a **concrete action**
  * a **felt emotion**
  * a **result**
* Anecdotes must be **time-situated** (“last week”, “during a meeting”, etc.).

### 2) Authenticity of speech

The speech must feel **spontaneous**, sometimes imperfect:

* hesitations
* slight contradictions
* language shortcuts
* mixed emotions (e.g., relief + doubt)
* “mundane” details (background noise, interruptions, etc.)

### 3) No rationalization

❌ Do not make the user speak like a product/UX/business expert.
❌ Do not justify behaviors after the fact with abstract concepts.
❌ Do not propose “ideal” solutions.
-----------------------------------

# 📌 Expected output format

For **each proto-persona**, produce:

## A. Interview context

* Type of participant (related to the Job, not demographics)
* Frequency of the situation
* Perceived risk level (low / medium / high)
* One contextual detail (e.g., “30-min meeting”, “after an incident”, “end of month”, etc.)

## B. Interview transcript (10–15 minutes)

### Recommended structure (Q/A)

**1. Warm-up (real context)**

* “Tell me about the last time you…”
  **2. Triggering situation**
* What triggered the need
* Why at that specific moment
  **3. Past behaviors**
* What was done concretely
* Tools used
* Workarounds
* One unexpected or clumsy detail (e.g., “I did that out of habit, even though it was useless”)
  **4. Friction moments**
* What caused problems
* Where the user felt stuck, confused or frustrated
* One moment where they hesitated or contradicted themselves
  **5. Trade-offs and decisions**
* What was sacrificed
* Why this solution rather than another
* A “bad but acceptable” compromise
  **6. Personal definition of success**
* How the user knew it “worked”
* Personal indicators, not professional ones
  **7. Light projection (optional)**
* “If you could change one thing…”
* Without asking for an ideal solution
* Just one simple and realistic change

---

# 🎭 Transcript style

* **Q/A** format (Interviewer / Participant)
* Natural spoken language
* Variable response length
* Time-situated anecdotes
* Include **at least 1 slight contradiction** per interview (without the user “correcting” themselves too neatly)

---

# 🚫 Strict anti-patterns

* ❌ Generic or universal answers
* ❌ “I would do X if the tool were perfect”
* ❌ Use of product, UX, or business jargon
* ❌ Overly smooth or idealized testimonies
* ❌ “Perfect persona” (always coherent, always rational)

---

# 🎯 Success criteria

Reading the transcript, one must be able to clearly answer:

* Which **precise JTBD** is at play
* What **real tension** the user is trying to resolve
* Where a solution can **fail** if poorly designed
  **Language**: French
  **Tone**: realistic, nuanced, sometimes imperfect
  **Level of detail**: usable for qualitative analysis

---

# 💡 Advanced options (optional but recommended)

Add at the end of the prompt:

* **“Generate 2 contrasting interviews per proto-persona”**
* **“Introduce counter-examples or unexpected behaviors”**
* **“Explicitly mark exploitable quotes”**
* **“Add a section ‘Possible raw insights’ (without interpreting them)”**
